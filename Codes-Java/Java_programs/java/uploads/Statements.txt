11. We have set of stars. The topmost row has 1 star, the next row down has 2 stars, the next row has 3 stars, and so on. Compute recursively (no loops or multiplication) the total number of stars to form a triangle with the given number of rows.

12. Create a Car class and define nested Engine class. Call void start() method from engine class. Assume suitable fields and methods.

13. Demonstrate Abstract class

14. Consider following:
abstract class Book{
    String title;
    abstract void setTitle(String s);
    String getTitle(){
        return title;
    }
}
